\section{Introduction}
This document was created after the NSAC trad climbing course of August 2024, with the goal to collect all the useful "tips and tricks" that were learned over the week.\\
It's not a manual on how to trad climb and there's no guarantee for correctness.\\
Think for yourself and make your own decisions.\\
You can fetch the latest version of this document on \href{https://github.com/leonclx/tradnotes_24}{github}. Feel free to \href{mailto:leon.cyliax@gmail.com}{email} me if anything seems incorrect.\\
I'd like to thank my course mates Adam, Dick, Jalmar, Quinten, Rutger, as well as the instructor Jeffrey Meesters and the mountain guide Nicolas Bartalucci for an amazing week in the alps :) \\
Many thanks to the NSAC ZP and NoÃ«l Diepens for organizing this course.
