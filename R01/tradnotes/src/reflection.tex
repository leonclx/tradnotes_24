After the tour when you're back at the hut/camping it's good to sit together with everyone and reflect on the day.
\begin{itemize}
\item Keep chronological order: approach, start of climb, during climb, descent
\item Discuss things that went well, things that could go better
\item Was the time planning correct? Were there any dangerous/unsafe things?
\item During the tour is not the right time for starting heated discussions
\item Be honest about mistakes and don't look for blame, instead discuss how to prevent them for next time
\end{itemize}
